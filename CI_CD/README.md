## CI - continous integration

### Continous integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It allows developers to frequently merge code changes, test, build and run.

## CD - continous delivery
Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. 

This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.

## CD - continous deployment
Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.
